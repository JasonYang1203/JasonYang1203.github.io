                        <p>I started swimming when I was six, and I became a national second-class swimmer after ten years of professional training.</p>

                        <p>Playing basketball is my favorite sport. I have played basketball for 7 years. It makes me so relieved when I am on the basketball court. I also attended some competitive matches when I was in high school.</p>

                        <p>Rubik's Cube is one of my hobbies. It was for fun when I started to figure out how to restore the cube. But as time went on, I watched some games played by professional cubers around the world, which motivated me to start learning different methods to solve different kinds of cubes. Now I have my personal ranking at 80 thousand+ in 3*3 Rubik's Cube and 50 thousand+ in pyramid cube throughout the world.</p>
